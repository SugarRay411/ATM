This Python code creates a simple ATM program that stores customer information in an SQLite database. 
It allows users to perform various transactions, such as viewing account information, changing their PIN, 
withdrawing or depositing cash, transferring funds between linked accounts, and quitting the program.
The user selects a transaction from the menu by inputting the corresponding number.
The program handles invalid inputs and checks that the input data is of the correct type.
